Introduction

Data Preparation Processes

Descriptive Statistic: Data Cleaning & Objectives for each datasets

Dataset 1: Covid-19 Age Group

No missing values detected - No Cleaning required

covid_cases_age.describe( ) - find mean, standard deviation of each age group who diagnosed with Covid-19 infection


Dataset 2: Malaysia cases

find missing values

from numpy import isnan

Importing the SimpleImputer class for filling NaN

To analyze the date frame of covid new cases 


Dataset 3:  Malaysia’s State Covid-19 cases

find missing values

from numpy import isnan

Importing the SimpleImputer class for filling NaN

List the states involved in the dataset

find the percentage of covid-19 new cases in each state

To investigate the states with the highest active cases of covid-19 (Jupyter Notebook)

Do a comparison on covid cases between partially vaccination, fully vaccination and with booster in all the states

Plot multiple line chart to compare the partially-vaccinated cases, fully-vaccinated cases and boosted cases in Selangor

Plot a boxplot to compare the covid child cases, adolescent case, adult case and elderly case


Dataset 4: Covid-19 Death Age group 

Find the missing values

from numpy import isnan

Importing the SimpleImputer class for filling NaN

Find the age group that contributed the highest death in Johor

Find the age group that contributed the highest death in Malaysia(vertical and horizontal barplot)


Dataset 5: hospital covid-19 cases

Compare the mean of covid beds in for state in Malaysia population

Plot a barplot to compare the number of beds in all states of Malaysia for COVID-19 cases

Compare the number of individuals or patients with covid in the hospital for each state in Malaysia population

Plot a barplot and line chart to compare among admitted cases and discharged cases of covid-19 in all states


Dataset 6: rtk-ag test versus pcr test in Malaysia

Plot a boxplot to do a comparison on both rtk-ag and pcr test


Dataset 7: COVID-19 Tests in the state level

plot a barplot to compare the antigen rapid test "rtk-ag" and pcr test in all states of Malaysia.

plot a barplot to compare the antigen rapid test "rtk-ag" and pcr test in all states of Malaysia after comparing with state population data

Plot a barplot for the number of rtk-ag test in all states of Malaysia(Jupyter notebook)

Plot a barplot for the number of pcr test in all states of Malaysia (Jupyter notebook)


Dataset 8: serious symptoms caused by different vaccines

Plot a barplot to compare the serious symptoms among vaccines sinovac, pfizer, astrazeneca and cansino

Find the month that reported with highest number of serious symptoms - suspected anaphylaxis


Dataset 9: Descriptive analysis of new deaths dataset


Dataset 10: Descriptive analysis of ICU situation dataset


Dataset 11: Descriptive analysis of the combination of dataset 9, 10 and new cases (state) dataset.
